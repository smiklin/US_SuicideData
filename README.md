## US Suicide rates 1900-2018


This is a repo for a shiny app that lets you explore changes in US suicide rates over time, across different characteristics. You can  find the app [here](https://smiklin.shinyapps.io/us_suicidedata/).

The repo contains [the PDFs](https://github.com/smiklin/US_SuicideData/tree/master/CDC%20Historical%20Data) from which I extracted the historical data (to complement the 1999-2000 data I generated through the [CDC's Wonder system](https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html), as well as the [aggregated dataset](/USrates1900clean.csv). You are welcome to use it with attribution.
